# dot-xmonad

This is my xmonad configuration.  Some of it is specific to xmonad, and
some is general graphical environment configuration.  The configuration
is managed with [homeshick][], which creates symlinks from the
appropriate locations in my home directory.  Installing dependencies,
compiling, and other setup tasks are handled using [Ansible][], which
runs the steps listed in `init.yml`.
